Today I'm exited to announce the release of icehrm v13.0 
for hosted installations. v13 comes with whole lot of features such as recruitment module, PTO for leave module and
some core improvements.

With IceHrm recruitment module now you can

- Post jobs
- Let candidates apply for these jobs
- Schedule interviews
- Track candidate progress with notes
- Share job links with linkedIn, facebook, twitter and google+ directly from icehrm

The PTO (Paid Time Off) feature of the leave module help you to configure initial set of leaves when moving from a
third party leave management system. Also it help you to add or remove leave from leave balance of an employee.

You can read more about PTO [here](/docs/leave-setup/)
