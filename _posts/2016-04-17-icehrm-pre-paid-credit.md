For some of our paid clients of hosted service, it was a bit of a trouble (and a time consuming process) 
to pay the monthly invoices. Because of that we now allow adding pre-paid credit to your icehrm hosting account.
Once you add pre-paid credit we reduce the payment from credit balance every time an invoice is generated.

Now your credit balance and transactions will be displayed under System -> Upgrade module.
