Today we have released IceHrm v19.0 for both open source and pro editions.

For those who are having an active Icehrm pro license will receive the upgraded version.

With this release we have made several modules such as Payroll, Overtime and HR forms available in IceHrm Pro.
Also there is a bunch of features such as multiple approval leaves, managers ability to view all the employees
in a department and sub structures of this department.

For the open source version we have added the overtime module, some bug fixes and multi level approvals.

Also now you can quickly setup the development environment for icehrm. We believe this will encourage
developers to submit more features and improvements. If you are willing to contribute Please go through
