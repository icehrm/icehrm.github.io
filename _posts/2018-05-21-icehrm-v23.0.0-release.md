We are happy to announce yet another release (v23.0.0) of icehrm packed with a bunch of useful features and improvements. Here are the highlights of this release:

- Recruitment module for IceHrmPro. With this, there will be no feature wise difference between IceHrm Cloud and IceHrmPro. 

- Public company-wide chat is available for IceHrm users. We hope to develop this feature into a full chat application by supporting private and group conversations in future releases.

- We have also added a public announcement module where administrators and managers can make public announcements.

- Now users can quickly switch language via the top menu bar.

- Improvements to German, Italian and Mandarin Chinese translations. Finnish is also added as a supported language but still on beta.

- Travel request module can now be customized by adding custom fields. We will continue to add custom field support for all other modules in future releases.

If you are an IceHrm Pro user you will receive an email with a download link within next few hours. All cloud installations are upgraded to new version.
