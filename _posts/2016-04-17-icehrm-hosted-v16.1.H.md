#### Payroll Reports (Beta)

As you already noticed we have released IceHrm v16.1.H for all the hosted installations with some major updates for payroll processing. Our payroll module is still in beta and it can be currently used for:

Generating reports required for submitting HR details to your payroll processing company.
Processing your own payroll with pre-configured rules. This is ideal for companies already processing their payroll using excel or some other methods.

We have not yet completed the documentation for this. But you may contact us via team@icehrm.com or thilina@gamonoid.com to get help configuring your payroll rules.

#### Prepaid Credit

Also with this upgrade we have started accepting pre-paid credit for icehrm hosting account. We now allow adding pre-paid credit to your icehrm hosting account.

Once you add pre-paid credit we reduce the payment from credit balance every time an invoice is generated and your credit balance and transactions will be displayed under System -> Upgrade module.

For adding pre-paid credits to your account please contact us via team@icehrm.com.
