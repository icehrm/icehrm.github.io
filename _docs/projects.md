Projects module is used to add projects and assign projects to employees

Each and every project is attached to a client. Because of that, IceHrm allow adding 
clients with basic information. Once clients are added, you can start creating project 
for these clients. The clients section represent both external and internal clients of the company. 
That way you can attach each and every project to a client.

### Employee Projects

these projects in time-sheets.
