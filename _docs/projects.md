Projects module is used to add clients, projects and assign projects to employees

Each and every project is attached to a client. Because of that, ICE Hrm allow adding 
clients with basic information. Once clients are added, you can start creating project 
for these clients. The clients section represent both external and internal clients of the company. 
That way you can attach each and every project to a client.

###Employee Projects
Under employee projects tab you can assign projects to employees. You need to add projects to employees to enable them to add time against 
these projects in time-sheets.
