In icehrm time cards are implemented using time sheets. Time sheets (http://blog.icehrm.com/docs/timesheets/) and attendance are different concepts in icehrm. 

#### Attendance

Attendance represent the time you were in office. It do not store what kind of a work you've been doing or 
on which project you have been working on. Also attendance can not be approved. 

- Admins can monitor attendance via <code>Manage->Attendance</code>
- Employees can register attendance via <code>Time Management -> Attendance</code>

#### Time Sheets

Time sheets and time entries represent actual work you have been doing. A time sheet which represent one week
can have multiple time entries. Once an employee completed a time sheet they can send it to direct 
supervisor for approval.

Timesheets can be accessed via <code>Time Management -> Timesheets</code>

You can export a report on daily time sheet details using "Employee Time Tracking" report under 
<code>Reports -> Reports</code> module
