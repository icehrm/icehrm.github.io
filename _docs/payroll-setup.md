### Elements of IceHrm Payroll Setup

### Define Payroll Employees and Pay Period

Under Payroll -> Payroll menu there is a tab named "Company Payroll" which you can use to add employees
to your payroll. Payroll will be calculated only for the employees added to "Company payroll". This is because
in some cases you need to use different rules to calculate payroll for different employee groups.

When adding a payroll employee you will notice that you need to select a "Pay Frequency". This
should match the "Pay Frequency" of the payroll report. Only then the payroll will be calculated
for an employee.
