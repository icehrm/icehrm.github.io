### Elements of IceHrm Payroll Setup

 - Company Payroll = The section to define which employees need to be added to the payroll
 - Payroll Report = An editable payroll report 


### Define Payroll Employees and Pay Period

Under Payroll -> Payroll menu there is a tab named "Company Payroll" which you can use to add employees
to your payroll. Payroll will be calculated only for the employees added to "Company payroll".

When adding a payroll employee you will notice that you need to select a "Pay Frequency". This
should match the "Pay Frequency" of the payroll report. Only then the payroll will be calculated
for an employee.
