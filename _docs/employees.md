Employees module is used to list, edit, add and search employees in your company. 
You can use the search box to search employees by ID, name or department. 
Also you can use filter button to filter employees by job title, department or supervisor.

###Difference Between Users and Employees

A user is a person who can login to icehrm. It’s not required for admin users to have an employee attached but 
each non admin user must have an associated employee. Having an employee added in icehrm won’t 
allow the person to login to icehrm. You need to create user with a Manager or Employee user level 
for that employee to be able to login to the system.

###Adding Employees

Adding employees to IceHrm can only be by the admin or manager. The employee Id field should have a unique value. 
In order to complete adding an employee you need to provide job title, employment status and pay grade. 
These values can be defined in admin: Jobs module.

Once an employee is added to the system you will be asked to create a user for the newly added employee

### Switching Employees

One of the key features of IceHrm is, admins and mangers ability to login as another employee. 

This feature can be used to apply leaves, add attendance records or update time sheets behalf of other employees.

To login as an employee you can use the  <b>switch to employee</b> icon on employee list or the “Switch Employee” menu in top right hand corner.
