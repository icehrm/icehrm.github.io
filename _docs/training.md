## Setting Up Training Module

Training module in IceHrm can be used to manage process of providing internal trainings for employees.

In training module we have courses, training sessions and training subscription management.

 1. Admins/Managers can define courses
 2. Admins/Managers can use courses to create training sessions
 3. Admin can assign courses to employees or employees can subscribe
 4. Employees can mark training sessions as attended and attach a proof of completion if required
 5. Admins/Managers can approve that the training session is completed by the employee
