This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to IceHrm. We'll cover topics such
as installing IceHrm and getting it up and running, configuring IceHrm and
using icehrm modules.

## What is IceHrm?

[IceHrm](http://icehrm.com) is a Human resource management system for small and medium sized organizations. 
It covers all the basic HRM needs of a company such as leave management, time management and  handling employee information.
