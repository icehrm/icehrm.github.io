### Audit Logging
The ICE Hrm Audit log module will enable administrators to track each and every action of your employees. 
This will help admins to find out possible root causes in cases such as misusing the system by employees, 
issues occur due to user errors. Also it will help administrators possibly  track  the location of the employee
(using recorded IP address ) to see whether they have logged into the system from inside the office or outside 
the office.
