#### Audit Logging
The IceHrm Audit Log records all the activities performed by different users in the system. An audit log can help you monitor activities and even identify any potential security breaches and prevent unfavorable events. To access the audit log, go to Admin -> Audit log.

In the audit log, you will be able to see:
1. The time an activity was performed
2. User
3. Employee name and id
4. Type of activity
